# FERIT Schedule

[Latest version](https://github.com/davidtakac/FeritSchedule/releases/latest)

## Description
This is a wrapper app for the [FERIT](www.ferit.unios.hr) online schedule.

Main feature:
- After setting the study programme and year you're currently in, the app will always load the current week and scroll to the current day each time you open it. 

Other features include: 
- Highlighting the groups you're in. For example, you can enter "LV4,KV2,PR-2" and each lecture of the type will be highlighted in red so you don't have to manually check each time
- Skipping days after a certain time.
- Skipping Saturdays
- Stripped down schedule webpage that only displays the most relevant elements(the lectures)
- Navigation bar that lets you navigate to previous, current and next week
- Dark theme

Every feature, other than the navigation bar, is optional and configured in the settings.

## Credit
- Robert Sorić helped me with the Javascript code needed to highlight lab groups. 
- [Luka Šimić](https://github.com/lsimic) pointed me in the right direction when I had trouble with CSS.

Thanks!

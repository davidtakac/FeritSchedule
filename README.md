# FERIT Schedule

[Downloads](https://github.com/davidtakac/FeritSchedule/releases/latest)

## Description
A simple wrapper app for the www.ferit.unios.hr online schedule. 

After you choose your study programme and year, the app will automatically display the schedule for the current week with the page scrolled to the current day. 

You can change your study programme and year using the menu. The app also allows highlighting the exercise groups you're in so you don't have to manually check every time. 

## Credit
Robert SoriÄ‡ helped me with the Javascript code needed to highlight lab groups.

Thanks!
